Project Overview
This project serves as an introductory exercise in modern web development, focusing on foundational concepts such as semantic HTML5 structure, accessibility best practices, and SEO-friendly page design. The goal is to create a clean, well-structured website that is both user- and search-engine-friendly.

Files Included
index.html
The main landing page introducing the assignment and demonstrating the use of semantic elements like <header>, <main>, <nav>, and <footer>. It emphasizes proper heading hierarchy, accessibility through ARIA labels, and SEO-friendly structure.

About.html
Provides an overview of the assignment objectives, highlighting semantic HTML, accessibility enhancements, and SEO considerations.

features.html
Lists the key features showcased in the assignment, including semantic HTML5 elements, logical heading hierarchy, accessibility best practices, and SEO-friendly metadata and content.

contact.html
Contains a simple contact form demonstrating accessibility features such as proper form labeling and required fields.

Key Concepts Demonstrated
Semantic HTML5 Elements:
Using tags such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> to give meaning and structure to the content.

Accessibility Best Practices:
Implementing ARIA labels, form labels, and logical heading order to ensure the website is usable by assistive technologies.

SEO-Friendly Structure:
Utilizing semantic tags, meaningful titles, and metadata for better search engine indexing.

Logical Heading Hierarchy:
Organizing headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) to enhance readability and navigation.

Known Issues / Notes
Some typos exist in the HTML code (e.g., hmtl instead of html, assisgnment instead of assignment, and some malformed attributes in the contact form).

The contact.html input for "Name" has an incorrect type attribute (type="text id"), which should be corrected to type="text".

The About.html section uses an id with a space (id="about us"), which is invalid in HTML and should be changed to a single word or hyphenated (e.g., id="about-us").

How to Run
Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser. Use the navigation links to explore the other pages (About.html, features.html, contact.html).
